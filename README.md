# Project Proposal
This project is proposed to offer some experiments related with [Wifi frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracking_of_wireless_networks), that can be used to perform security related operations.

It was created to be:

* Full based on [Espressif NonOS](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/sdks-demos)
* Self contained, no external libraries
* Minimal IO, for minimal ESP8266 (_ESP01_)

# Features
* Access Point Scanner
* Packet Sniffer
* PCAP Serializer
* Client Deauthentication
* Network Spam
* Probe-Request Spam
